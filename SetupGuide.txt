Copy-paste the pom.xml file in the project's folder as well and do a maven update(Right-click
project -> Maven -> Update Project, check 'Force Update of Snapshots/Releases" and ok. Make sure the src folder is in
the project source's build path. (Go to the project -> configure build path, in the Source tab).
